        Hi my name is Sven Meza I am 15 years old and this is my about me page.<br>
        A career goals I'd like to achieve is to be a website designer/maker.<br>
        Some actions to reach this goal is taking this class and I plan to<br>
        attend the AP classes to keep learning.<br>
        <br>
        Strength that I have are that I'm a quick learner I believe this since<br>
        always found it easy to learn how to do my tasks at school. I am also <br>
        calm in stressful situations and can think rationaly during them. I'm<br> 
        like this since I have learned tolorate others to them work together with<br>
        them.<br>
        <br> 
        I also believe that I'm responsible since I try my hardest to do any work<br>
        given to me. I will own up to the concequences of anything I have done wrong<br>
        instead of trying to hid it or pin the blame on someone else. I am also<br>
        intellegent since I am always looking for new things to learn whick has made<br>
        me very knowledgeable
        <br>
        Thank you for taking the time to read this. I hope this has helped you learn a<br>
        little more about me. I hope you enjoy the rest of my web site.<br>
        </p>
